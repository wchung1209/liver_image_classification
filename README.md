# Image Classification with a Convolutional Neural Network

This repo contains code for a liver image classification using a convolutional neural network. 

The original data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orvile/annotated-ultrasound-liver-images-dataset.
The data contains 735 images of liver ultrasound with labels: Normal, Benign, and Malignant.

I use a convolutional neural network model to perform a binary classification and a multiclass classification. The code is cleaned to show only the final version of the models and includes EDA, cleaning, augmentation, and modeling.
